              Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mario Morelos, currently pursuing a computer
              science degree at Texas A&M University, set to graduate in May
              2024. For me, Computer Science is akin to solving mind-bending
              puzzles â€“ each challenge is an opportunity to delve into the
              exhilarating world of problem-solving.

              My primary focus lies in software development, though I'm also
              captivated by the field of cybersecurity. Exploring this interest
              led me to delve into a fascinating course, 'Software Reverse
              Engineering,' where I delved into binary exploitation techniques,
              concealing code and unraveling such complexities using tools like
              Ghidra.
